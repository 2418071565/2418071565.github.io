## 审题

+ **单位**！！！！！！！
	+ per person per gram
	+ metric tonnes
+ 图例
	+ 数字和国家名字
+ 文字标题

## 开头段

> 改写原题 写1-2句
>
> **（把below删了）**

### show的代替

+ **compare**

	+ 如果题目中涉及到两者以上的东西，可以用这个

		+ eg: 

      The pie charts below show unit of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000.

      The pie charts compare **the source of** electricity in Australia and France during the two decades from 1980.

+ **illustrate**



## 动态图

>  动态特点（跟自己比）：上升、下降、持平（波动）

### Overall

1. 非常重要，不能漏；

2. 2-3句话，尽量概括；
3. 不要出现数据

### 主体段

+ 按照时间顺序写

> 概括整体变化趋势（整体上升/下降）
>
> 哪一类数据整体上高于/低于其他的各类数据

分段原则（主体2段）：上升vs下降vs持平

XXX increased/decreased **to varying degrees** (不同程度地上升、下降). 

There were various degrees of increase/decrease in XXX

#### 段内比较

+ 变化的程度 especially + 变化特别明显的对象 A；另一个对象B：B increased as well, but less noticeably. 

不要忽略特别明显的静态特点：**始终最大/小+ 超越成为第一**



## 静态图

### 主体段

+ 按照高低顺序写
+ 分段思路：A>B VS A<B VS A=B

> 概括他包含哪几类数据
>
> 哪一类数据整体上高于/低于其他的各类数据



## 要包括的特征数据

+ 起点/终点（动态图）
+ 变化趋势（动态图）
  + 不同label的差距有没有变小？
    + the gap between the three categories narrowed significantly over the second half of the period（在后半段显著减小差距） 

  + 先上升后下降？
  + 显著上升？
  + 缓慢下降？
  + 不同年份之间的倍数关系？

+ 极值/等值/倍数关系（比较意识）
  + xx and yy are **the same**(98 litres), **while** zz is slightly lower()
  + about twice as large as xxx
  + the highest
  + the lowest
  + the second largest
  + It is interesting to note that …, **interestingly**, the performances of A and B in X and Y **were equal**. 
  + **Surprisingly / not surprisingly** 
+ 静态图：
  + 最大的是xxxxxxxx
  + 第二大的是xxxxxxx
  + （By contrast, ）最小的是xxxxxx


## 好用的表达

### Overall

+ We can see ...
+ It is clear from the xx graph that ...

### Be popular (prevalent) 

+ XXX became more popular **over the years**(动态)
+ A was more popular than B（静态）
+ prevalent（一般指坏东西）

### Be likely to do sth （可能做某事）

+ Sb became more likely to do sth(动态)
+ Sb were more likely to do A than to do B(静态)

### 如何表达A> B

学物理的男生比女生多

+ Male students who studied physics **were** **more than** female students who did the same. (少见)
+ **The number of** male students who studied physics was higher/ greater/larger/more than **that** of female students who did the same. 
	+ **The number of** xxx was more than **that of** xxx who kakkaka
+ More male students than female students studied physics. 
+ \*Male students **outnumbered** female students in physics. 
+ Physics was more popular among/with males than **among/with** females
+ Males **were more likely to** study physics than females (did)
+ Males **seemed to** be more interested in physics than females. 

### 如何表达倍数关系     

+ The number of male students who studied physics was over/more than four times higher/ greater/larger/ more than **that** of female students who did the same.
+ **The number/amount of** A **is four times the number/amount of** B
+ The number/amount of B is xxx, four times the number/amount of B
+ increased to **around half** that amount of xx

### 越…越…结构  

> The+比较级+主语+动词(谓语/表语)，the+比较级+主语+动词(谓语/表语)

+ 人越老，经验越丰富
	+ The older people are, the more experience they have/the more experienced they are.
+ 你越努力，进步就越快 
	+ The harder you work, the faster progress you make.
+ 问题越难，他回答出来的可能性就越小
	+ The more difficult the problem is, the less likely he can answer it/work it out. 
+ 一个国家经济越发达，国民支出花在生活必需品的比例就越小 
	+ The more developed a country’s economy is, the lower percentage of the citizens’ money is spent on life necessities/ the less of the citizens’ money is spent on life necessities. 

### 排名语言

+ … followed by …
+ A is the largest, while D is the lowest. The other (B, C) are **in between**. 
+ the second largest

### 成正比、成反比

+ A **correlates** positively/negatively with B
+ A is **(inversely) proportional** to B
