### 满意的工作：好学校vs平稳不变的职业道路

>  Some people believe that **the best way** to **get to a satisfying career** is to study in a **good college or university**. Others say that **keeping a steady and unchanged career path** is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

####  一稿

Nowadays, how to find a satisfying job has become a hot issue in society, which triggers civilizations’ consideration. Different individuals hold various opinions about it, and here are two typical viewpoints as follows.

 

Some people believe studying in a good college or university is significantly important. First and foremost, it is the better education system and quality that good colleges or universities offer that can help students to gain useful knowledge. By utilizing it for job-hunting, they can get satisfactory offers. Additionally, lots of the personnel managers in big companies just take a rapid scan of candidates’ resumes and depend on whether they have the opportunity to be interviewed just by the level of their college or university. Consequently, they are more likely to get a satisfying career than others who don’t have the chance as big companies always guarantee higher salaries and better interests and rights for their employees usually.

 

While others believe that keeping a steady and unchanged career path is more crucial. Firstly, People can harvest profound working experience from a steady and unchanged career path with the accumulation of work experience and professional knowledge, which is harder to learn from just the theoretical knowledge from college or university. What’s more, it is easier for people to find pleasure in the work, promote enthusiasm for their job, and improve satisfaction in their careers. Owing to the frequently changing job may get on their nerves and give them a sense of unsettlement, which will pose stress on their career path.

 

As far as I am concerned, the path to a satisfying career requires the combined efforts of a college education and a career path. On the one hand, a good college or university can offer individuals a strong platform to get better jobs. On the other hand, it is vital to ensure a steady career path to achieve success in their occupation.

### 机器人给人类好处vs坏处

> Some people think that robots are **very important to** human’s future development, while others think they **are dangerous and have negative effects** on society. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Nowadays, much controversy has been aroused over whether robots are significant to human beings. Different individuals hold various opinions about it, and here are two typical viewpoints as follows.

Some people believe that the field of robotics will bring a diversity of promising benefits to human beings. First and foremost, robots **confer** economic benefits, as increased productivity and efficiency in diverse industries lead to economic overall growth. For instance, those companies that employ robots, which can handle more workloads than their human counterparts, would have more potential to **boost their output**, **generate higher profits**, and thus **contribute to social economy development**. What's more, robots are **competent** for high-risk jobs, preventing humans from **getting injured in** hazardous environments. In that case, they can be great helpers for us to explore the world, such as outer space, and the application of robots not only can push the boundaries of scientific research, but also provides substantial assistance to the development and security of human society. Therefore, our human beings would have **a bright future** with the equipment of the expanded knowledge learned through robots.

Others, however, argue that robots could **pose a threat** to humans. Firstly, Since there are increasing numbers of companies trying to utilize robotic workers, more laborers, especially those poor blue-collar workers may lose their jobs, and then the unemployment rate would rise. As a result, artificial intelligence may **have negative influences on** income equality. In addition, the lack of laws and ethical standards currently for robots is likely to induce malicious use. This means that whether robots could be regarded as the subject of responsibility is still a controversial issue.

In my view, although the second viewpoint holds water to some degree, I'm still favorably inclined toward the first idea that robots could make a big difference to our humans, as long as **they are utilized appropriately**, **equipped with** cutting-edge technology, ethical safeguards, **and additional benefits for citizens.** 



+ the consequences of robots could be **unpredictable**.
+ promising bright hopeful optimistic encouraging
