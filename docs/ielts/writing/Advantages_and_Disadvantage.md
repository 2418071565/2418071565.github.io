### A Law to Limit Working Hours for Employees

> Some countries have introduced **a law to limit working hours for employees.** How can this law be introduced? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?

#### 一稿

Nowadays, some countries enact a law which limits working hours for employees. **As far as I am concerned**, the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. 

It is significant for the government to introduce the standard and reasonable working hours per day and week. First and foremost, not only can it assure employees of appropriate working hours, but also it can protect employees' interests and rights in legal terms. Only in this way, can employees defend themselves correctly and effectively when their company require them to work overtime illegally. What’s more, employees may be more effective with the implementation of the law. With the proper working hours that can reduce workers' fatigue, they can concentrate on what they need to cope with. Additionally, it allows them to spend more time on themselves, such as hanging out with friends, accompanying their families, and developing hobbies, which is easier said than done in the past due to the unfair working hours.

Moreover, the law should include overtime pay. However, this development also has some negative aspects as follows. Firstly, the business costs will increase as companies have to pay more salary if they want their employees to work overtime. Even worse, the heavy financial pressure the law causes will lead to bankruptcy for small companies which can’t afford the heavy labour costs. Furthermore, more people may lose their jobs due to this development and even contribute to the economic recession.

In a nutshell, although this development has some disadvantages, the pros outweigh the cons. Consequently, more and more countries must introduce reasonable and appropriate laws which limit working hours for employees to protect their rights and interests.

#### 修改建议

> 6~6.5分

1. **“This law be introduced” 单独成段写**
   + i.e. As far as how this law can be introduced, the first thing is to …
2. several countries -> some countries 不要瞎改 就some就可以
3. **权益：统一写成rights and interests**
4. 员工 更有生产率 effective -> productive
5. With the proper working hours**/time for relaxation** that can reduce workers' fatigue, they can better concentrate on what they need to cope with.
6. 一些小语法问题：workers fatigue -> workers' fatigue， for后面跟动名词。。。。。
7. **陪伴家人 不要用accompany， 用stay with their families**
8. unfair -> prolonged working hours
   + 可以用一个词：**working duration** 名词性词组，长时间工作
9. However, this development also has some negative aspects as follows.  as follows很鸡肋 不要写
10. 缺点写得太夸张了（economic recession），可以轻一点
11. 最后结尾并没有说明利大于弊的原因，可以写一写如何减轻弊的影响（比如效率高了工作更好能创造更多的利润，或者弱化一下弊端）



#### 别人写的好的

也是6～6.5

To begin with, the limited working time could **guarantee workers’ efficiency.** **Although countries with long average working hours are often viewed as being economically successful, when it comes to the gross output, it is the efficiency that matters, instead of working duration.** **Overlong working hours** may **lead to burnout（精疲力竭）, distractions and mistakes**. The companies have to spend more on employee administration as well.

In addition, the regulation restricts the work duration. In other words, it eliminates the possibility of unreasonable scheduling by superiors as well as reduces improper overtime arrangements, **safeguarding the labour’s rights and interests**. Exploiting employees for higher production is quite immoral and **reprehensible**. **Extra pay cannot compensate（补偿） for negative mental pressure.** 

Furthermore, the control of the upper limit of working contributes to an increase **in leisure and recreation** and thus better **work-life balance**. People are encouraged to enjoy themselves **in a work-life balance lifestyle**, which is beneficial to an individual’s physical and mental health. **Fewer stress-related illnesses contribute to the reduced costs of healthcare**, and just regulation is conducive to social harmony and stability（这句的逻辑有点牵强）. Thus the atmosphere of the whole society would be more positive（这句的逻辑有点牵强）. **Social development should not be at the expense of personal well-being.**

In a nutshell, even though the working duration bears great significance, the drawbacks of prolonged working hours outweigh the merits. **The implementation of the relevant legislation** is bound to bring about improvements in various respects.



#### 二改



Nowadays, some countries enact a law which limits working hours for employees. **As far as I am concerned**, the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. 

**As far as how this law can be introduced, the first thing is to** introduce the standard and reasonable working hours per day and week. A good example of this is the implementation of 35-hour workweek in France, **which has shown positive effects on both employee happiness and productivity**. Moreover, the law should include overtime pay. If it is **mandated** by law, then employee are more likely to put in extra effort when required, forsering a harmonious work culture.

**On the one hand, the development has a variety of benefits.** First and foremost, not only can it **assure employees of appropriate working hours**, but also it can **protect employees' interests and rights in legal terms**. Only in this way, can employees **defend themselves correctly and effectively** when their company require them to work overtime **illegally**. What’s more, employees may be more productive with the implementation of the law. In that case, hirelings would be less fatigued and more efficient with the work-life balance lifestyle. Therefore, it is much easier for them to concentrate on the work they need to cope with. Additionally, it also provides them the oppotunity to allocate more time for personal pursuits, such as **socializing with friends**, **staying with their family**, and developing new hobbies, which was a challenge in the past given **the inequitable working hours**.

**On the other hand, it is true that the development has some drawbacks.** Firstly, the business costs will increase as companies have to pay more salary if they want their employees to work overtime. Consequently, it is acknowledged that businesses may need to **adjust their pricing or budget allocation** to **accommodate the increased labor expenses**. Moverover, while the policy aims to protect employees‘ well-being, **in reality,** it sometimes can **pose challenges for industries with time-sensitive projects**, as the **project timeline** may need to **be extended** owing to the limited working hours.

In conclusion, I believe it is a positive development as long as the government **takes proactive measures** to **mitigate/alleviate potential negative finacial impacts**. This not only protects employees‘ **rights and interests** but also **contributes to the long-term improvement of companies' economic outcomes**.
