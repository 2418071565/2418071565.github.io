this/these后面紧跟一个普通单数/复数名词时，指代前面分论点中提到的某个/某些事物

---

#### 🌟方法2. 与分论点直接相关的名词

the elderly = elder people = the old generation = ...

## 例子

i.e. Save business cost

1. Save rental charges for offices
2. Save the cost of electricity, desks and other office facilities 

+ Which one is better?
  + 1,因为显然租金是大头。

 

i.e. Greenhouse effect will worsen 

+ Burning of fossil fuels => produce more greenhouse gases + occupy forests => absorb less greenhouse gases => the concentration of greenhouse gases rises => trap the heat => growth of temperature => iceberg melting => land covered => environmental changes => species vanish. 

 

下雨 =>… =>迟到

 

Regular exercise => … =>stay healthy
