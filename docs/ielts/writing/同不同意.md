## 练习

### 自己养老 

Some people say that it is the responsibility of individuals to save money for their own care after they retire. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

**政府投资类（政府该不该掏钱，xxx该不该免费）**

政府应该掏钱的理由：减轻老百姓负担（穷人）；如果政府不掏钱，没有人（严重后果）(私营企业认为没有回报)

政府不必掏钱的理由：很多老百姓负担得起 + 政府是钱有限的（用在那些更需要政府花钱的地方（public education，infrastructure Improvement, medical care, environmental protection） 

 

1. Agree：

> It is the responsibility of individuals to save money for their own care after they retire/ individuals have the **responsibility** to save money for their retirement life. 
>
> Lose motivation to work harder / Worsen population ageing 

 

2. Disagree：

> individuals should not have this responsibility alone (Children + the government)

### 纸质书要被取缔

Printed books and even libraries are no longer necessary, since people can access information on the internet. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

 

Play **irreplaceable** roles in certain cases. 



Agree：not so necessary/less necessary （much of the information that used to be obtained from books and libraries can now be easily acquired online）

Disagree: still necessary / 1. **Reliability** of the information (vs. established writers/authors) (young students, beginners) 2. 



### 青少年罪犯被严厉惩罚

Causes of **juvenile delinquency**: 

1. In their formative years, (**do not know how to distinguish right from wrong**) + Criminal ideas are **engrained**根深蒂固的/  community services （appreciation, recognition -> feel needed / a sense of achievement） 反过来：send them to prison -> prison is school of crime (first-time offender -> habitual criminal)
2. Family environment: lack of supervision(监督) -> peer pressure (the desire to be popular among a peer group is stronger than the desire to progress -> do wrong things to avoid being isolated) + negative media influence -> People should not be held fully responsible for what they do not have entire control of. 
3. They are by nature immature and have difficulty in controlling their negative emotions
